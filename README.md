                           INSTRUCTIONS ON FIXTURING THE SPEEDOMETER

- Ziptie the sensor to the fork of your bicycle, ziptie the computer part to your handlebars, 
- ziptie the sensor cable in such a way that it does not get pulled on in any steering position





                           INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE THE SPEEDOMETER

- First step: plug the power cable into a 2000mAh to 2750mAh powerbank that lacks no load shut-off
- Second step: Power on the powerbank, and then flip the switch to either km/hr or Mi/hr
- Third step: Start riding, but use a trip meter alongside this speedometer because this speedometer does not keep distance.




                                         ANY UPDATES?

I will regularly revise the code if there are any bugs, and there will also be a version which does count distance
